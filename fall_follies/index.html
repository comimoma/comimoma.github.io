          <h3>JOIN THE ULTIMATE HALLOWEEN PARTY IN 2021 &#x1F609;</h3>
          <p>This year at Spooky Grove Night, the haunted trail is ready! We can't
            wait for everyone to join and experience all of our Halloween events
            with friends and families. After the long wait at home and isolation
            of pandemic, we are excited to scare our guest away in our Spooky Grove
            trail.<br><br>

            It will take place at Spooky Town Park and tickets can be purchased
            at entrance. There's a strange and shadowy wonderland that everyone's
            been whispering about. Starting in late morning till an hour before
            midnight, we will have many activities ready in the field, including
            pumpkin carving, pumpkin pie and pumpkin latte giveaway, games like
            treasure hunt and fear factor, raffle, Jack o' lantern competition,
            Halloween supper, costume parade, dance party with photo booth available,
            and the most thrilling part -- Haunted Grove! In addition, there will
            be food trucks and souvenir stands for our guests. Entrance will be open
            whole day and our guests are welcome to re-enter by showing the original
            ticket to our staff.<br><br>

            Let's share a secret, we've summoned Jack oâ€™ lanterns from the mystical
            sphere and deivsed a spooktacular illumination light show under the
            autumn sky! Shhh.. you won't see it on the event schedule because only
            our guests deserve the Halloween surprise. Be sure to get your cameras
            or phones ready and enjoy the fascinating time with us!
